### Hi! I'm Angelo.

I'm a passionate software engineer that programs for fun. I love to do research and development to create innovative projects.

Below, you will find a few of the things I'm enthusiastic about (in no particular order)...

* **Learning new things**
* Binary Analysis
* Reverse Engineering
* Embedded Systems
* Code Security and Obfuscation
* LLVM
* Build Systems
* Cryptography
* Computer Vision and Machine Learning

## Statistics

Please take these with a grain of salt; most of the projects I have created are closed source reverse engineering research.
